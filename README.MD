This is a 4-function calculator (plus exponents!) It looks like this:

# Installation

This is a QT Creator project, written against QT Creator 7.0.1 in Windows 10.

 - [ ] Install QT Creator 7.0.1
 - [ ] Open the project file by double-clicking "qtwidgetscppapplication.pro"
 - [ ] Press Ctrl-R to run or the green Run button in the lower-left.

You should see a spiffy 4-button calculator. If it doesn't work the first time then this is not the app for you.

## Cross-platform
I heard that QT is like cross-platform or something.  Maybe you can try installing QT Creator on your own platform and see if you can open and run the project file!

If so, let me know how you did: rviragh+tao@gmail.com
